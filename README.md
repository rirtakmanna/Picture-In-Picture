## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://rm-picture-in-picture.netlify.app)

Picture in picture allows you to use any video run in a small window that can above any tab and any website. I'm using screen capture API for this to capture (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API) the video screen and display it in picture in picture mode. for more information about the picture in picture mode refer css-tricks.com (https://css-tricks.com/an-introduction-to-the-picture-in-picture-web-api)
